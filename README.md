# FIU Qiskit Fall Fest 2025
Florida International University Qiskit Fallfest 2025 


## What is Fall Fest?
The Qiskit [kiss-kit] Fall Fest is a mixture of hackathons, challenges, and workshops related to quantum computing, held at various universities around the world. We are proud to be one of the 55 Universities that have been selected to be supported by IBM Quantum and their quantum software development kit, Qiskit.

Our Fall Fest event will involve tutorials, presentations, guided challenges & workshops. It will be held in-person on the Florida International University campus in Miami, FL, from November Friday 6PM ET through Sunday 3pm ET. Agenda details (specific times and locations) will be posted here as speakers confirm, so keep checking back. All guided challenges will be written in Python using Qiskit and shared with participants.

## Who is this event for? 
This event is for everyone, whether you have never heard of quantum computing or you are a seasoned developer or researcher, there will be something for everyone. 
There will be both technical tracks as well as business tracks, for those who are interested in the use cases beyond the computational aspects.
